# Waste-Classification-Multi-Domain-AI-Predictive-Analytics
AI-powered solutions for real estate price prediction, waste classification, and gold price forecasting, combining machine learning and deep learning to deliver practical business insights.

### Project Overview *(Focus: Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Business Scenario Modelling, Sustainability)*
This project focused on building an advanced waste classification and management decision-support system using **machine learning, statistical analysis, and business optimisation models**. It aimed to help waste management authorities improve classification accuracy, predict collection volumes, and optimise operational planning based on real-world waste data. The dataset contained **over 50,000 individual waste records** across different categories, regions, and timeframes.  

The work was divided into **three major tasks**, each adding a critical component to the final system:  
1. **Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis** – cleaning, transforming, and profiling the dataset to identify trends and irregularities.  
2. **Predictive Modelling** – applying classification algorithms to predict waste types with high accuracy.  
3. **Business Scenario Analysis** – evaluating operational and financial impacts of implementing the model at scale.

### Task 1 – Data Preparation & Exploration
- Cleaned and transformed raw waste management data by removing missing and duplicate entries, resulting in a **99% complete dataset**.  
- Conducted **descriptive statistics** to identify patterns in waste generation, revealing that **organic waste accounted for 42%** of total volume, followed by recyclables at **31%**.  
- Created visualisations to compare seasonal and regional waste variations, showing a **15% spike in waste volumes during December–January** in coastal regions.

### Task 2 – Predictive Modelling
- Built and tested multiple machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.  
- The **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy at **93.4%**, with strong performance in predicting both high-volume organic waste and lower-frequency hazardous waste.  
- Feature importance analysis revealed that **waste source type** and **geographic location** were the top two predictors of classification accuracy.  
- The model reduced manual sorting errors by an estimated **25%**, potentially saving **$180,000 annually** in operational costs.

### Task 3 – Business Scenario Analysis
- Simulated implementation of the classification system across three regions, projecting a **20% reduction in landfill waste** over 12 months.  
- Financial modelling indicated potential annual savings of **$500,000–$650,000** from reduced sorting costs and better recycling revenue streams.  
- Conducted sensitivity analysis to account for variations in waste volume, collection schedules, and recycling prices, ensuring robust decision-making.

### Business Impact

**Key Outcomes**  
1. Improved waste classification accuracy from manual average rates (~75%) to over 93%, reducing sorting inefficiencies.  
2. Projected substantial operational cost savings while supporting environmental sustainability goals.  
3. Delivered a data-driven approach for waste collection and sorting that can scale to different regions.  

**Advantages**  
- Significant cost savings through reduced errors and improved recycling efficiency.  
- Better environmental impact due to reduced landfill contributions.  
- Scalable solution adaptable to multiple regions with varying waste profiles.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Model performance relies on continuously updated and clean data.  
- Implementation requires investment in staff training and technology upgrades.  
- Possible resistance from stakeholders accustomed to manual processes.
